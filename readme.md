# Gaia Digital Agency - Selection Matrix

## Installation
1. Ensure the directory structure:
   - index.html
   - src/styles.css
   - src/script.js
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Logic (Normal Distribution)
The algorithm uses **Weighted Complexity Scoring**. 
Most common selections (e.g., WordPress + Brochure + Standard Security) result in **Visual Customization**.
"Full Bespoke" is only triggered when high-complexity stacks (Laravel/MERN) are paired with high security and dynamic data needs.

## Printing
Clicking **Print to PDF** uses CSS `@media print` rules to hide UI buttons and generate a clean document for client meetings.
